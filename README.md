# Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for designing and implementing a modern Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to streamline and automate the hiring process. The system will leverage AI for candidate matching, support SSO authentication, and provide robust analytics and workflow automation.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication & Security
- **SSO Login**: Support Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with popular identity providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Okta).
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Define roles (e.g., recruiter, hiring manager, admin) with appropriate permissions.
- **Data Security**: Ensure secure storage and transmission of sensitive applicant data.

### 2. Resume Management
- **Resume Collection**: Allow candidates to upload resumes via web portal, email, or integrations (e.g., LinkedIn, job boards).
- **Resume Parsing**: Automatically extract structured data (skills, experience, education, contact info) from uploaded resumes using NLP/AI.
- **Candidate Database**: Store parsed candidate profiles in a searchable, scalable database.

### 3. Candidate Profiling & Matching
- **Multiple Ideal Candidate Profiles**: Allow recruiters to define multiple fictitious ideal candidate profiles for each job opening, each representing different candidate archetypes or role variations.
- **Weighted Ideal Candidates**: Assign weights (1-100) to each ideal candidate profile to indicate their relative importance or desirability for the position.
- **AI Matching**: Use AI/ML algorithms to match and score candidates against each ideal candidate profile, generating match percentages (0-100%) for each profile.
- **Weighted Scoring System**: Calculate composite scores using the formula: `(Match Percentage × Ideal Candidate Weight) / 100`. For example:
  - 100% match on weight-50 ideal candidate = Score of 50
  - 75% match on weight-100 ideal candidate = Score of 75
- **Filtering & Ranking**: Enable filtering and ranking of candidates based on weighted composite scores, individual match percentages, skills, experience, and other criteria.

### 4. Data Model for Weighted Scoring
- **Job Opening**: Contains multiple ideal candidate profiles, each with associated weights.
- **Ideal Candidate Profile**: Structured data including skills, experience, education, certifications, and assigned weight (1-100).
- **Candidate Match Result**: Stores match percentage for each ideal candidate profile and calculated composite score.
- **Scoring History**: Track how composite scores change over time as AI models improve or ideal candidate weights are adjusted.

## Scoring Formula Examples
```
Example 1: Senior Developer Position
- Ideal Candidate A (Full-Stack Expert): Weight = 100, Match = 80% → Score = 80
- Ideal Candidate B (Frontend Specialist): Weight = 70, Match = 95% → Score = 66.5
- Ideal Candidate C (Backend Specialist): Weight = 85, Match = 60% → Score = 51
Final Composite Score = 80 (highest individual score)

Example 2: Alternative Scoring (Average Weighted)
Final Composite Score = (80 + 66.5 + 51) / 3 = 65.8
```

### 4. Interview & Workflow Management
- **Interview Scheduling**: Integrate with calendar systems (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook) to schedule interviews with shortlisted candidates.
- **Workflow Automation**: Track and automate candidate progress through customizable hiring stages (e.g., application, screening, interview, offer, hire).
- **Notifications**: Automated email and in-app notifications for candidates and hiring team at each workflow stage.

### 5. Analytics & Reporting
- **Hiring Analytics**: Provide dashboards and reports on key hiring metrics (e.g., time-to-hire, source effectiveness, diversity, pipeline health).
- **Scoring Analytics**: Track performance of ideal candidate profiles, including which profiles generate the most successful hires and optimal weight distributions.
- **Match Quality Metrics**: Analyze correlation between composite scores and actual hiring success to improve AI matching algorithms.
- **Ideal Candidate Performance**: Report on which ideal candidate archetypes are most effective for different roles and departments.
- **Custom Reports**: Allow users to generate and export custom reports based on filters, stages, and scoring criteria.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Support reporting for legal and regulatory compliance (e.g., EEOC, GDPR).

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Ideal Candidate Management System
- **Profile Creation Interface**: Intuitive UI for creating and editing multiple ideal candidate profiles per job opening.
- **Weight Assignment**: Slider or numeric input for assigning weights (1-100) to each ideal candidate profile.
- **Profile Templates**: Ability to save and reuse ideal candidate profiles across similar job openings.
- **Profile Validation**: Ensure weights are properly assigned and profiles are complete before activation.

### 2. AI Matching Engine
- **Multi-Profile Matching**: Capability to match each candidate against multiple ideal profiles simultaneously.
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Implementation of weighted scoring system with real-time calculation of composite scores.
- **Match Explanation**: Provide detailed breakdown of why a candidate matched or didn't match specific criteria.
- **Threshold Configuration**: Allow recruiters to set minimum composite score thresholds for different hiring stages.

### 3. Candidate Ranking & Filtering
- **Composite Score Display**: Show both individual match percentages and weighted composite scores in candidate lists.
- **Multi-Criteria Sorting**: Sort by composite score, individual ideal candidate matches, application date, or custom criteria.
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter by score ranges, specific ideal candidate matches, skills, experience levels, etc.
- **Score Visualization**: Charts and graphs showing candidate distribution across score ranges and ideal candidate types.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: System should support growth in users, candidates, and job postings.
- **Reliability**: High availability and robust error handling.
- **Performance**: Fast search, filtering, and AI matching for large candidate pools.
- **Integrations**: APIs for integration with HRIS, job boards, and third-party tools.
- **Usability**: Intuitive, accessible UI for all user roles.
- **Audit Logging**: Track all key actions for security and compliance.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- **Mobile App**: Native or responsive mobile experience.
- **Video Interviewing**: Built-in or integrated video interview platform.
- **Offer Management**: Automated offer letter generation and e-signature.
- **Onboarding Integration**: Seamless handoff to onboarding systems.
- **Machine Learning Optimization**: Automatically suggest optimal weights for ideal candidates based on historical hiring success.
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Test different ideal candidate configurations and weights to optimize hiring outcomes.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Predict candidate success probability based on composite scores and historical performance data.
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: AI-powered automatic adjustment of ideal candidate weights based on market conditions and hiring success rates.
