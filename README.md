# Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for designing and implementing a modern Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to streamline and automate the hiring process. The system will leverage AI for candidate matching, support SSO authentication, and provide robust analytics and workflow automation.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication & Security
- **SSO Login**: Support Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with popular identity providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Okta).
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Define roles (e.g., recruiter, hiring manager, admin) with appropriate permissions.
- **Data Security**: Ensure secure storage and transmission of sensitive applicant data.

### 2. Resume Management
- **Resume Collection**: Allow candidates to upload resumes via web portal, email, or integrations (e.g., LinkedIn, job boards).
- **Resume Parsing**: Automatically extract structured data (skills, experience, education, contact info) from uploaded resumes using NLP/AI.
- **Candidate Database**: Store parsed candidate profiles in a searchable, scalable database.

### 3. Candidate Profiling & Matching
- **Ideal Candidate Profile**: Allow recruiters to define a fictitious ideal candidate profile (skills, experience, education, etc.) for each job opening.
- **AI Matching**: Use AI/ML algorithms to match and score candidates against the ideal profile.
- **Filtering & Ranking**: Enable filtering and ranking of candidates based on AI match scores, skills, experience, and other criteria.

### 4. Interview & Workflow Management
- **Interview Scheduling**: Integrate with calendar systems (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook) to schedule interviews with shortlisted candidates.
- **Workflow Automation**: Track and automate candidate progress through customizable hiring stages (e.g., application, screening, interview, offer, hire).
- **Notifications**: Automated email and in-app notifications for candidates and hiring team at each workflow stage.

### 5. Analytics & Reporting
- **Hiring Analytics**: Provide dashboards and reports on key hiring metrics (e.g., time-to-hire, source effectiveness, diversity, pipeline health).
- **Custom Reports**: Allow users to generate and export custom reports based on filters and stages.
- **Compliance Reporting**: Support reporting for legal and regulatory compliance (e.g., EEOC, GDPR).

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: System should support growth in users, candidates, and job postings.
- **Reliability**: High availability and robust error handling.
- **Performance**: Fast search, filtering, and AI matching for large candidate pools.
- **Integrations**: APIs for integration with HRIS, job boards, and third-party tools.
- **Usability**: Intuitive, accessible UI for all user roles.
- **Audit Logging**: Track all key actions for security and compliance.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- **Mobile App**: Native or responsive mobile experience.
- **Video Interviewing**: Built-in or integrated video interview platform.
- **Offer Management**: Automated offer letter generation and e-signature.
- **Onboarding Integration**: Seamless handoff to onboarding systems.
