- **Flexible Weighting**: Dynamic attribute importance based on role requirements
- **Multiple Archetypes**: Support for diverse ideal candidate profiles per position

### 2. Scalable Architecture
Designed for enterprise-scale deployment:
- **Microservices**: Independently deployable and scalable services
- **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes orchestration with auto-scaling
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous processing for performance
- **Multi-Tenant**: Organization-level data isolation

### 3. AI-Powered Intelligence
Advanced machine learning throughout:
- **Resume Parsing**: NLP models for structured data extraction
- **Career Pattern Recognition**: Classification of candidate archetypes
- **Predictive Analytics**: Success probability based on historical data
- **Smart Scheduling**: AI-optimized interview time slot selection

### 4. Compliance-First Design
Built-in compliance and privacy protection:
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Right to be forgotten, data portability
- **EEOC**: Adverse impact analysis and bias detection
- **SOC 2**: Security controls and audit logging
- **Data Lifecycle**: Automated retention and anonymization

### 5. User Experience Focus
Intuitive interfaces for all user types:
- **Recruiter Tools**: Streamlined candidate sourcing and evaluation
- **Hiring Manager**: Easy decision-making with clear recommendations
- **Candidate Experience**: Transparent process with regular updates
- **Admin Controls**: Comprehensive system configuration
