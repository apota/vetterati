# Applicant Tracking System (ATS) Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for designing and implementing a modern Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to streamline and automate the hiring process. The system will leverage AI for candidate matching, support SSO authentication, and provide robust analytics and workflow automation.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Authentication & Security
- **SSO Login**: Support Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with popular identity providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Okta).
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Define roles (e.g., recruiter, hiring manager, admin) with appropriate permissions.
- **Data Security**: Ensure secure storage and transmission of sensitive applicant data.

### 2. Resume Management
- **Resume Collection**: Allow candidates to upload resumes via web portal, email, or integrations (e.g., LinkedIn, job boards).
- **Resume Parsing**: Automatically extract structured data (skills, experience, education, contact info) from uploaded resumes using NLP/AI.
- **Candidate Database**: Store parsed candidate profiles in a searchable, scalable database.

### 3. Candidate Profiling & Matching
- **Multiple Ideal Candidate Profiles**: Allow recruiters to define multiple fictitious ideal candidate profiles for each job opening, each representing different candidate archetypes or role variations.
- **Weighted Ideal Candidates**: Assign weights (1-100) to each ideal candidate profile to indicate their relative importance or desirability for the position.
- **Attribute-Level Weighting**: Enable granular weight assignment to individual attributes within each ideal candidate profile, including:
  - Years of general industry experience
  - Years of relevant/domain-specific experience
  - Education level and prestige
  - Professional certifications and licenses
  - Average tenure at individual jobs (job stability)
  - Company types worked at (startup vs. big corporation)
  - Career progression patterns (big fish in little pond vs. little fish in big pond)
  - Leadership experience and team management
  - Technical skills depth vs. breadth
- **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) Integration**: Implement AHP methodology for structured decision making that:
  - Breaks down complex hiring decisions into hierarchical criteria
  - Performs pairwise comparisons between attributes to derive priority weights
  - Ensures consistency in decision-making through consistency ratio calculations
  - Handles multi-criteria decision analysis with mathematical rigor
- **AHP-Guided AI Matching**: Use AI/ML algorithms enhanced with AHP framework to:
  - Match candidates against each ideal candidate profile using weighted attributes
  - Generate match percentages (0-100%) for each profile based on AHP-derived weights
  - Provide explainable AI decisions showing contribution of each attribute to final score
- **Weighted Scoring System**: Calculate composite scores using AHP-weighted attributes and ideal candidate weights
- **Filtering & Ranking**: Enable filtering and ranking of candidates based on AHP-guided composite scores, individual match percentages, and specific attribute criteria.

### 4. Data Model for AHP-Based Weighted Scoring
- **Job Opening**: Contains multiple ideal candidate profiles, each with associated weights and AHP hierarchy definitions.
- **Ideal Candidate Profile**: Structured data including:
  - Demographic and experience attributes with individual weights
  - AHP pairwise comparison matrices for attribute prioritization
  - Derived priority vectors from AHP calculations
  - Consistency ratios to validate decision matrix coherence
- **AHP Hierarchy Structure**: Multi-level decision tree including:
  - **Level 1**: Overall candidate fit (goal)
  - **Level 2**: Major criteria categories (Experience, Education, Cultural Fit, Technical Skills)
  - **Level 3**: Specific attributes (years of experience, education prestige, company types, etc.)
- **Candidate Match Result**: Stores detailed scoring breakdown including:
  - Individual attribute scores and weights
  - AHP-calculated composite scores for each ideal candidate profile
  - Explanation vectors showing attribute contribution to final scores
- **AHP Calculation Engine**: Mathematical framework for:
  - Eigenvalue calculations for priority derivation
  - Consistency index and ratio computations
  - Sensitivity analysis for weight adjustments

## AHP-Based Scoring Formula Examples

### Example 1: Senior Software Engineer Position with AHP Weighting

**AHP Hierarchy:**
```
Goal: Best Senior Software Engineer
├── Technical Experience (40% weight via AHP)
│   ├── Years of Programming (60%)
│   ├── Relevant Tech Stack (30%)
│   └── Architecture Experience (10%)
├── Leadership & Growth (30% weight via AHP)
│   ├── Team Management (50%)
│   ├── Mentoring Experience (30%)
│   └── Career Progression (20%)
├── Cultural Fit (20% weight via AHP)
│   ├── Company Size Preference (40%)
│   ├── Work Style Compatibility (35%)
│   └── Values Alignment (25%)
└── Education & Certifications (10% weight via AHP)
    ├── Degree Level (70%)
    └── Professional Certifications (30%)
```

**Candidate Scoring:**
```
Ideal Candidate A (Tech Lead Type): Weight = 100
- Technical Experience: 85% match × 40% weight = 34 points
- Leadership & Growth: 90% match × 30% weight = 27 points  
- Cultural Fit: 75% match × 20% weight = 15 points
- Education: 80% match × 10% weight = 8 points
Total AHP Score: 84 points → Final Score = 84

Ideal Candidate B (IC Expert Type): Weight = 70
- Technical Experience: 95% match × 40% weight = 38 points
- Leadership & Growth: 40% match × 30% weight = 12 points
- Cultural Fit: 85% match × 20% weight = 17 points  
- Education: 90% match × 10% weight = 9 points
Total AHP Score: 76 points → Final Score = 53.2 (76 × 0.7)
```

### Example 2: Career Pattern Analysis
```
Big Fish/Little Pond vs Little Fish/Big Pond Assessment:
- Candidate from startup (big fish): Leadership weight +20%, scope weight +15%
- Candidate from FAANG (little fish): Process weight +25%, scale weight +30%
AHP automatically adjusts attribute weights based on career pattern classification.
```
